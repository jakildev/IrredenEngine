# TASKS

Shared task queue for parallel agents. Both human and agent maintainers
append here, and the next unblocked item is what an idle agent should pick up.

## How to use this file

1. **Picking a task:** skim the `## Open` section. Find the first `[ ]` item
   whose **Owner** is `free` or your worktree name, and whose **Blocked by**
   list is empty. Change its status to `[~]` (in progress), set Owner to your
   worktree, and push the edit in your first commit so other agents see it.
2. **Finishing a task:** change `[~]` to `[x]`, set the final commit or PR
   URL in the **Links** line, and move the item to `## Done — last 20` at
   the bottom. Keep only the last 20 done items; prune older ones.
3. **Adding a task:** append to `## Open` with the template below. Err on the
   side of creating small tasks (one PR's worth of work). If a task needs
   research first, file it as `Research:` — the deliverable is a short
   findings note, not code.
4. **Blocking on another task:** put the blocking task's title in
   **Blocked by**. An agent should skip blocked items.
5. **Touching this file:** always stage and commit `TASKS.md` edits in the
   same PR as the work they describe, so history stays consistent. Don't
   land a TASKS change as its own drive-by PR unless it's purely queue
   maintenance.

This file is the **engine-level** task queue. Private creations that live
under `creations/` may define their own `TASKS.md` inside their own
directory — those are tracked independently and should not be mixed here.
Do not queue game or creation-specific gameplay tasks in this file; queue
them in the creation's own `TASKS.md`.

## Task template

```
- [ ] **<short title>** — <one-line goal>
  - **Area:** engine/render | engine/entity | engine/prefabs/... | docs | build | creations/demos/... | ...
  - **Model:** opus | sonnet  (which model should run this)
  - **Owner:** free | <worktree-name>
  - **Blocked by:** (none) | <title of blocking task>
  - **Acceptance:** <concrete check: build passes, test X passes, PR merged, screenshot Y looks like Z>
  - **Notes:** <context, links, prior attempts>
  - **Links:** (fill in PR URL when done)
```

Status markers: `[ ]` open, `[~]` in progress, `[x]` done, `[!]` blocked/stuck.

### Model tagging (important)

Tag every task with the intended model. Default assumption:

- `[opus]` — anything touching `engine/render/`, `engine/entity/`,
  `engine/system/`, `engine/world/`, `engine/audio/`, `engine/video/`,
  `engine/math/` (non-trivial), or ECS/render optimization, or concurrency,
  or ownership/lifetime rules. Also final review on anything important.
- `[sonnet]` — test generation, doc passes, mechanical refactors with a
  clear spec, first-pass code review, clearly-scoped items already thought
  through, anything in `creations/demos/`, small bounded shader tweaks.

A Sonnet agent that picks up an `[opus]` task should escalate instead of
charging ahead. A Sonnet agent that finds a `[sonnet]` task is subtler
than expected (touches an invariant, a lifetime, a race) should stop and
requeue with `[opus]`. The top-level `CLAUDE.md` has the full split.

## Good tasks to queue here (engine-only)

Small and bounded is the target. Good shapes for this queue:

- **Test generation** — "write exhaustive tests for `engine/math/physics.hpp`
  ballistic helpers"
- **Docs / API reference** — "document every `IRRender::` free function in
  `engine/render/CLAUDE.md`"
- **Benchmark / profiling report** — "profile `IRShapeDebug` at zoom 4 with
  N voxels and file a report"
- **Isolated refactor** — "port `engine/common/ir_constants.hpp` to constexpr"
- **Build / CI hardening** — "add a `format-check` CI target that fails on
  stale clang-format output"
- **FFmpeg / audio interface hardening** — "add bounds checks to
  `VideoRecorder::submitVideoFrame` stride handling"
- **Compile-time cleanup** — "reduce `engine/render/` TU rebuild cascade by
  moving X out of the hot header"
- **Shader hygiene** — "extract repeated iso-projection math in
  `engine/render/src/shaders/` into `ir_iso_common.glsl`"

Avoid:

- Tasks that touch core ECS types (`engine/entity/`) — do those by hand.
- "Refactor the render loop" — too broad, no single PR scope.
- Anything that would require changing the public `ir_*.hpp` surface across
  multiple modules in one PR.
- Gameplay or content work for any specific creation — belongs in that
  creation's own task queue.

## Open

<!-- Add tasks below this line. -->

- [ ] **Linux build maturation: get `linux-debug` preset green end-to-end** —
  fix every compile/link/runtime issue encountered when building the
  engine against the new `linux-debug` CMake preset inside WSL2 Ubuntu
  24.04. This is the umbrella epic — break it into smaller follow-up
  tasks as concrete issues are found.
  - **Area:** engine/* (anywhere the Linux path breaks)
  - **Model:** opus (for anything touching core-engine invariants) /
    sonnet (for mechanical port fixes like missing `#include`, case-
    sensitive paths, EOL drift)
  - **Owner:** free
  - **Blocked by:** (none)
  - **Acceptance:** from a fresh WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04 clone,
    `cmake --preset linux-debug && cmake --build build -j$(nproc)`
    builds `IRShapeDebug`, `IRCreationDefault`, and `IrredenEngineTest`
    with zero warnings escalated to errors, and `IRShapeDebug` launches
    via WSLg without crashing on its first frame.
  - **Notes:** the engine was originally written against Windows +
    MSYS2. Expect missing Linux branches under `#ifdef _WIN32`, missing
    system libs (update the apt list in `docs/AGENT_FLEET_SETUP.md` §1
    as you find them), case-sensitive include mismatches, and EOL
    drift. Every real fix should land as its own dedicated PR — do
    **not** bundle unrelated Linux-port fixes into feature work.
    Reference `docs/AGENT_FLEET_SETUP.md` §10 for the list of known
    first-time issues.
  - **Links:**

- [ ] **Example: benchmark IRShapeDebug at zoom 4** — measure per-system
  timing and file a report.
  - **Area:** engine/profile
  - **Model:** opus
  - **Owner:** free
  - **Blocked by:** Linux build maturation (if running in the fleet;
    the Windows-native clone can start this immediately)
  - **Acceptance:** `docs/perf-reports/shape_debug_zoom4.md` exists with
    per-system `easy_profiler` screenshots and a 1-paragraph summary of the
    top 3 hotspots.
  - **Notes:** use `IRShapeDebug` from `creations/demos/shape_debug/`. See
    `engine/profile/CLAUDE.md` for the macros and how to enable the
    profiler build flag.
  - **Links:**

- [ ] **Example: unit tests for engine/math/physics.hpp** — exhaustive
  tests for ballistic helpers.
  - **Area:** engine/math
  - **Model:** sonnet
  - **Owner:** free
  - **Blocked by:** (none — unit tests don't care which platform builds them)
  - **Acceptance:** new test binary builds, tests cover all four physics
    helpers (`impulseForHeight`, `flightTimeForHeight`, `heightForImpulse`,
    `isTunnelingSafe`) with edge cases, all pass.
  - **Notes:** pattern-heavy; the function spec is in
    `engine/math/CLAUDE.md` under "Physics". If a test uncovers a real bug
    in the helpers, stop and requeue as `[opus]` with a bug report rather
    than fixing inline.
