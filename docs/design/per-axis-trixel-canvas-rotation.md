# Smooth camera Z-yaw via per-axis trixel canvases

Status: **design, not yet implemented.** This doc is the architecture for
*smooth* continuous world-camera Z-yaw — rotation that visually interpolates
between the 90° cardinals instead of snapping. Read
[`voxel-face-rasterization.md`](voxel-face-rasterization.md) (which faces a
voxel emits) and [`iso-depth-axis-invariant.md`](iso-depth-axis-invariant.md)
first; this builds directly on both.

## Problem

Continuous camera yaw is plumbed end to end (`Camera::setYaw` →
`computeYawSplit` → `rasterYaw` cardinal + `residualYaw ∈ [−π/4, π/4]`), and
the per-face *shape* deformation is implemented (`faceDeformationMatrix` →
`faceDeform_[slot]` UBO → `emitDeformedFace`, T-293 / #1257 / #1262 / #1278).

But the rotation **snaps to 90° increments** because the raster applies the
residual only to the *face shape*, never to the *voxel center*:

```glsl
base  = pos3DtoPos2DIso( rotateCardinalZ(p, cardinalIndex) + cardinalLowerCornerShift )  // INTEGER, cardinal-snapped
emitDeformedFace(base, D = faceDeform[slot])   // D skews the diamond AROUND the fixed base
```

So within a ±45° bracket every voxel center is frozen at its cardinal screen
position and only the faces skew; at 45° the whole layout snaps 90°. The
continuous reprojection function (`pos3DtoPos2DIsoYawed(worldPos, visualYaw)`)
exists in the shaders but has **zero callers for positions**.

The history: T-058/T-322 *did* swing centers (rotated the whole canvas image
in screen space) — smooth but bilinear-blurry. T-293 replaced it with crisp
per-face deform but gave up the center swing. **Nobody has shipped crisp *and*
smooth-centered**, because the obvious fix — reproject every voxel center
continuously on the *one* shared canvas — re-introduces tiling seams.

## Why one canvas can't do it

The integer trixel raster only tiles gap-free when voxel centers land on the
**even-parity integer iso lattice** (`(iso.x + iso.y) & 1 == 0`). The 2×3
diamonds interlock on that lattice. Under residual yaw the three visible faces
deform *differently* — one axis's faces go **skinny** (compressed), one
**stretched**, the Z-face **rotates** — so for any given screen pixel the
occupant could be an X-face, a Y-face, or the Z-face, each at a different
scale. Forcing all three onto one canvas makes their supersampling taps
collide on shared pixels: they fight, and you get seams / checkerboard / the
#1256 lattice artifact.

## Core idea: three per-axis trixel canvases

Split the voxel→trixel raster into **three trixel canvases, one per face
axis** (X / Y / Z — each holds whichever ± face of its pair is currently
visible). Each canvas carries **one uniform deformation** for all voxels, so
each is internally gap-free (a uniform affine map of a regular sub-lattice is
still a regular lattice). The three are unified only at the framebuffer, by
depth.

```
voxel ─┬─ X-face ─→ X-axis trixel canvas  (uniform D_X, "skinny" basis)
       ├─ Y-face ─→ Y-axis trixel canvas  (uniform D_Y, "stretched" basis)
       └─ Z-face ─→ Z-axis trixel canvas  (uniform D_Z, in-plane-rotated basis)
                         │
                three trixel→framebuffer passes (each with ITS OWN basis)
                         │
              framebuffer depth composite: per pixel, nearest distance wins
```

When *drawing a voxel*, each visible face is routed to its axis-canvas; that
canvas decides **which trixel the face occupies** from a calculation on the
camera rotation and the voxel's world position, using that canvas's own
deformed geometry.

## Per-canvas geometry varies; depth does not

- **Geometry (basis + extent) is per-canvas and yaw-dependent.** Each canvas
  is a uniform affine map (`D_X` skinny, `D_Y` stretched, `D_Z` rotated) of
  the voxel lattice. The trixel→framebuffer **basis (slopes)** and the grid
  **width/depth** therefore differ per canvas and change with yaw — the
  stretched axis's trixels expand to larger framebuffer footprints and its
  grid spans more; the skinny axis's span less. This is the key departure from
  today's single fixed grid: **three independently-sized, independently-sloped
  grids.**
- **Depth is the shared invariant.** The value written per trixel is
  `pos3DtoDistance` of the voxel-face's world position — one world-space
  scalar, computed identically regardless of which axis-canvas it lands on. It
  does **not** vary per canvas. That is what makes the framebuffer composite
  valid: overlay the three canvases, take the nearest distance per framebuffer
  pixel, and the correct face wins. Holds for **yaw only** — Z-yaw preserves
  the iso-depth axis so the metric stays comparable; pitch/roll would break it
  (see iso-depth-axis-invariant.md).

## Pipeline

1. **Stage 1 — voxel → three axis canvases.** Camera yaw θ and the visible
   triplet are known. For each voxel, route each visible face to its
   axis-canvas; compute the owning trixel from θ + world position via that
   canvas's geometry; write **shared `pos3DtoDistance` + color**. Voxel centers
   are **continuously repositioned** (`pos3DtoPos2DIsoYawed`) — now safe,
   because within a canvas the deform is one consistent affine.
2. **Stage 2 — three trixel→framebuffer passes.** Each canvas expands its
   trixels into framebuffer pixels using **its own basis**; each `atomicMin`s
   its distance into the **shared framebuffer depth buffer** and writes color
   where it wins.
3. **Stage 3 — winner resolution.** Nearest distance across the three canvases
   wins per framebuffer pixel (shared metric → valid).
4. **Fast path.** At `residualYaw == 0` the three canvases collapse to today's
   single uniform grid → byte-identical to current behavior, zero extra cost
   when not rotating.

## Bounded textures + minimum on-screen trixel size

The canvases are dynamic (geometry changes with yaw), so the textures are
allocated **once at the worst-case size** and reused — never reallocated
per-frame. The bound:

- Residual is capped at ±45° (beyond that we rebracket), so the
  **stretched / rotated** axis maxes at **√2× the cardinal extent** — bounded.
  (At φ=45°, `faceDeformationMatrix`'s stretched column has length √2; the
  Z-face rotation's bounding box grows by √2.)
- The **skinny** axis is the unbounded risk: as a face goes edge-on its
  on-screen width → 0, so naively covering the screen needs → ∞ trixels. The
  floor is a **minimum on-screen trixel size** (≈ 1 framebuffer pixel): once a
  trixel would render below it, the face is edge-on and its screen area is
  **already covered by the other two visible faces** (the hexagonal voxel
  footprint is always fully covered by the triplet), so the canvas resolution
  is capped there with no gap.

So each axis-canvas texture is sized once to `√2 × cardinal extent` in
footprint and `screen-resolution / min-trixel-size` in density. Bounded,
finite, no per-frame reallocation. The min-trixel-size value is a tuning
decision (see Open decisions).

## Face-jump at the rebracket

As θ sweeps through ±45° the cardinal flips and the **visible ± face on the
swept axis swaps** (e.g. the X-axis canvas: −X face shrinking toward edge-on →
+X face arriving edge-on). This is clean **by construction**: the swap instant
is exactly when both faces are edge-on (zero on-screen contribution), so the
outgoing face has shrunk to nothing and the incoming grows from nothing — no
pop. The min-trixel-size cap and the rebracket coincide. The implementation
inherits the existing rebracket machinery (`rasterYaw` cardinal snap, residual
sign flip, `cardinalLowerCornerShift`); the new requirement is that each
axis-canvas's **face identity swaps at the zero-width instant**, validated
under continuous rotation (#1271 `--spin-yaw`).

## Parity in the trixel→framebuffer conversion (the #1 implementation risk)

The trixel raster lives on the **even-parity iso sublattice**
(`(iso.x + iso.y) & 1 == 0` — the same set integer voxels project to; see the
SDF/voxel parity note in `engine/render/CLAUDE.md`). Get parity wrong and you
get the #1256 checkerboard / lattice artifact, gaps, or double-writes at the
framebuffer.

Each per-axis canvas applies its **own** deformed basis in the
trixel→framebuffer expansion, so the parity / interlock math must be
**re-derived per canvas** so that:

- adjacent trixels within a canvas still tile gap-free **and** never
  double-write the same framebuffer pixel after the affine basis is applied;
- CPU and GPU classify half-integer positions identically (use `roundHalfUp`,
  never `glm::round` — the CPU/GPU consistency rule in `.claude/rules/cpp-math.md`);
- the parity rule is consistent with the per-canvas basis at *every* yaw in the
  ±45° bracket, not just at the cardinal.

**Every implementation ticket below carries parity validation as a hard
acceptance gate** — continuous-rotation sweeps + native-resolution ROI crops
inspected for checkerboard / lattice / seam artifacts (`render-debug-loop`,
`tools/img_diff`).

## Relationship to per-entity SO(3) (#1272)

This split is clean for the **camera** because there is **one global
rotation** — every voxel's X-face shares `D_X`, so each axis-canvas has a
single uniform deform. **Per-entity SO(3) (#1272) is a different beast:** each
entity rotates independently, so faces on the same axis would carry *different*
deforms and the uniform-canvas property breaks. Per-entity smooth rotation
therefore stays on its own mechanism — detached canvases (true smooth, own
render target) or the octahedral-snap + per-entity residual main-canvas path
scoped in #1300. **Camera-smooth-yaw and per-entity-smooth-rotation are two
different mechanisms**; do not try to force #1272 through the three-axis-canvas
split.

## Open decisions (resolve during implementation)

- **Lighting / AO placement.** AO samples neighbor faces. With three layers it
  either runs **post-composite** on the resolved framebuffer (winning face-id +
  normal carried through the composite — preferred) or per-canvas (duplicated
  work). Pick post-composite unless a blocker emerges.
- **Memory / allocation policy.** Three worst-case textures during rotation;
  gate allocation on `residualYaw != 0` so static scenes pay nothing. Define
  the allocate/free churn behavior at rotation start/stop.
- **`min-trixel-size` value.** ≈ 1 framebuffer pixel is the starting point;
  tune against seam-free coverage vs texture size.
- **Per-canvas basis derivation.** Exact mapping from `residualYaw` (and
  cardinal) to each canvas's basis + extent; reuse `faceDeformationMatrix`.

## Decomposition (implementation tickets)

Stacked; each blocks on the previous and on this design doc's PR merging
(architect docs-first discipline). All `[opus]` — hottest compute path +
parity correctness.

- **T1 — per-axis canvas infrastructure** + bounded worst-case texture sizing +
  min-trixel-size cap + `residualYaw == 0` fast-path collapse to the single
  canvas (byte-identical guarantee).
- **T2 — Stage-1 routing + per-canvas deformed geometry** + continuous center
  reposition (`pos3DtoPos2DIsoYawed`); write shared `pos3DtoDistance` + color
  per axis-canvas.
- **T3 — three trixel→framebuffer passes + framebuffer depth composite** +
  face-jump/rebracket cleanliness; **parity re-derivation + validation** is the
  core of this ticket.
- **T4 — AO / lighting on the resolved composite** (winning face-id carried
  through; no double-rotation drift).

## What to verify when implementing

1. **Parity.** No checkerboard / lattice / seam / double-write per canvas at
   *every* yaw in the bracket — native ROI crops, not downscaled full-frames.
2. **Smoothness.** Centers swing continuously by distance from the rotation
   center; no 90° layout snap. `--spin-yaw` continuous sweep.
3. **Rebracket.** Face-jump is invisible (swap at zero width); no pop at ±45°.
4. **Byte-identical at cardinal.** `residualYaw == 0` matches current master
   pixel-for-pixel (fast path).
5. **Bounded memory.** Textures sized once to the worst case; no per-frame
   reallocation; no unbounded growth as a face goes edge-on.
6. **Depth composite.** Correct occlusion across the three canvases under
   rotation (shared metric).
