# Per-axis yaw GPU delta — per-stage attribution (#2281, post-#2273)

Phase-1 measurement record for #2281: *where does the residual yaw-vs-cardinal
GPU frame delta live, per stage?* #2256 attributed a residual delta to the
per-axis lighting/composite stages and closed via PR #2273 (occupied-cell
indirect dispatch), which A/B'd **perf-neutral on Metal** — the machinery
landed, the delta did not recover. This is the measurement-only attribution
that gates the Phase-2 lever decision (a design gate; **no lever is picked
here**).

Read alongside [`gpu-stage-timing-cost-model.md`](gpu-stage-timing-cost-model.md)
— the reading contract for these timers.

## Method

- **Tool:** existing per-system GPU stage timers, drained at shutdown to
  `save_files/profile_report.txt` (`--- GPU stage timing ---` table,
  avg/min/max over the run). No new timers, no engine changes (plan §Phase 1).
- **Driver:** `IRPerfGrid --auto-profile 300` (enables frame timing, resets
  the accumulators, runs 300 frames, dumps the report).
- **Scenes / poses:** two scenes × {cardinal (yaw 0), `--yaw 0.35` rad ≈ 20°,
  non-cardinal → per-axis path active}, **3 repeat runs each** (12 runs).
  - **Scene A** — `--mode voxel_set --zoom 3` (the #2256 header pose; 262 144
    voxels, high zoom).
  - **Scene B** — default wave scene (`IRPerfGrid`, default zoom).
- **Host:** macOS / Metal, shared 4-pane fleet host (not strictly quiet). The
  run-to-run noise bound below is well under every reported delta, so the
  findings hold regardless; absolute ms should not be quoted off-host.
- **Backend note:** Metal only. The per-axis path has a known run-to-run
  nondeterminism at fixed pose (#2255, open) — the repeat-run spread captures
  it.

## Reading these numbers — the per-stage rows overlap, they are NOT additive

The single trustworthy top-line is **frame time** (Δ +58.7 ms / +6.2 ms). The
per-stage rows must be read through the Metal encoder-window semantics
([cost-model §1](gpu-stage-timing-cost-model.md)): each row spans *[first
encoder start on GPU, last encoder end on GPU]* for that system's whole tick.
When the per-axis work is one back-to-back GPU burst with no intervening CPU
sync, adjacent stages' windows **overlap** and each reads roughly *"my start →
end of the whole burst."* Two direct symptoms in the data:

- **Yaw:** `voxelStage1` (65.8), `computeVoxelAO` (65.6), `trixelToFb` (69.2)
  read *near-identical windows with matching min/max* — and their deltas sum
  to ~165 ms against a **+58.7 ms** frame delta. They are measuring one shared
  ~65 ms per-axis burst, not three separable costs.
- **The "drops" are re-attribution, not real work.** `bakeSunShadowMap`
  (14.8→0.09) and `computeLightVolume` (17.9→3.2) do not get *cheaper* under
  yaw — the sun-shadow bake / 128³ light volume are pose-independent. At
  cardinal their windows happened to swallow the GPU backlog; under yaw the
  per-axis stages open earlier windows that claim it, so bake/lightVolume fall
  back to their true (small) isolated cost.

So the honest per-stage conclusion is a **band, not a line item**: the whole
yaw delta lives in the per-axis fan-out burst — the `voxelStage1` bundle
(per-axis raster ×3 into the X/Y/Z canvases), `computeVoxelAO` (per-axis AO
textures), and `trixelToFb` (per-axis depth-tested composite). The current
whole-tick timers cannot split that burst further, and `voxelStage1` is a
bundle row regardless ([cost-model §1 rule 2](gpu-stage-timing-cost-model.md)).

## Findings

1. **The yaw delta is real, large, and reproducible** — ≈3.5× frame time at
   zoom 3, ≈1.7× at default zoom, run-to-run spread far below the delta. It did
   **not** recover after #2273. Not a "not reproducible" close.
2. **It is the per-axis fan-out burst**, measured as one overlapping ~65 ms
   window across `voxelStage1` + `computeVoxelAO` + `trixelToFb`. No single one
   of those rows is separately trustworthy here.
3. **Coverage/occupied-cell-bound, not invocation-count-bound.** Every mover
   scales ~10–12× between Scene B (default zoom) and Scene A (zoom 3), tracking
   on-screen coverage × subdivision density — the same conclusion the
   cost-model doc reached for #2256, now confirmed at two poses.
4. **`resolvePerAxisScreenDepth` is not a mover** — 0 samples in the perf_grid
   pipeline at either pose (its per-axis screen-depth resolve is not a
   separately-tagged system in this scene; folded into the burst above). This
   matches the #2271 finding that the resolve sweep reads ~0.
5. **Secondary infra finding for #2280:** the whole-tick encoder-boundary
   timers systematically mis-attribute cost between adjacent stages of a
   sync-free GPU burst (several adjacent rows read near-identical inflated
   windows — cardinal: `voxelStage1`/`bake`/`lightVolume`/`trixelToFb` all
   ~15–18 ms; yaw: the three above all ~65 ms). Any per-axis sub-stage scopes
   #2280 adds must bracket their own encoders to be separable.

## Phase-2 recommendation (design gate — architect decides)

Per the plan and [cost-model §3 rule 1](gpu-stage-timing-cost-model.md)
("attribute before re-architecting"), **do not pick a per-stage lever from
this table** — the three big rows are one unseparated burst, and the
cost-model doc has now twice refuted picking a lever off a whole-tick / mostly-
empty read (#2266, #2271). The band-level attribution points at the per-axis
**fan-out** (three canvases + their AO) as the structural driver; the candidate
levers, each with the decisive probe it needs *first*:

- **Collapse the 3 per-axis passes toward union coverage** (one pass over the
  union of occupied cells instead of three per-axis sweeps). Probe: sub-stage
  scopes (#2280 pattern extended to the per-axis burst) to confirm the 3×
  fan-out — not per-cell body cost — is the driver.
- **Reduce per-axis AO cost.** Probe: force a uniform body reduction in the
  per-axis AO kernel and diff `computeVoxelAO` (#2266 method) — confirm the AO
  body, not its dispatch grid, holds the cost before touching it.
- **Reduce per-axis raster cost.** Blocked on #2280 — `voxelStage1` is a bundle
  and cannot attribute to the per-axis raster sub-dispatch until intra-tick
  scopes exist.

Also weigh **whether to pursue at all**: the delta only appears at non-cardinal
residual yaw (a transient during rotation, the per-axis canvases free at the
cardinal), and #2255 (per-axis nondeterminism) is still open on the same
surface. Cardinal / static scenes are byte-identical and unaffected.
