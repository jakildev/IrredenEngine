# Renderer
The rendering for the Irreden engine is implemented using OpenGL 4.6. The rendering pipeline consists of 3 main steps that result in a pixelated isometric rendering of 3D voxels.
 Takes a unique aproach to rendering voxels with a fixed isometric perspective. Instead of using ray marching to render voxels to the screen,
fixed voxel grid
ray looking?


### Rendering Pipeline

#### 1. Voxels to canvas

#### 2. Canvas to framebuffer

#### 3. Framebuffer to screen
