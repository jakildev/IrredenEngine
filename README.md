# Irreden Engine

## Make a cool banner image (need font rendering first)

## About
The Irreden Engine is an isometric pixel-art voxel content and game engine.

**NOTE: This project is still in the alpha stages and the structure of it is subject to change!** If you implement this engine, your implementation might not be compatible with future versions.

## Features
-   Connects to an audio interface for to send and receive midi and *audio* data. TODO: audio.
