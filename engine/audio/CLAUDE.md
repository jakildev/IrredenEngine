# engine/audio/ — MIDI I/O, audio capture, file playback

Thin wrapper around RtMidi (MIDI in/out), RtAudio (input capture), and
miniaudio (file playback). There is no synth — creations that need
generated tones still produce them themselves or pipe MIDI to an external
synth — but `.wav`/`.ogg` **playback** of SFX and music is built in (#1813).

## Entry point

`engine/audio/include/irreden/ir_audio.hpp` — exposes `IRAudio::` free
functions:

- `getAudioManager()`, `getMidiIn()`, `getMidiOut()`, `getAudio()`.
- MIDI device enumeration: list ports, open by index or substring.
- MIDI query: per-channel, per-frame CC/note-on/note-off queues.
- MIDI send: `sendMidiMessage(message)` (default port) / `sendMidiMessage(portIndex,
  message)` — raw RtMidi bytes. (There are no `sendNoteOn`/`sendNoteOff`/`sendCC`
  helpers; build the `C_MidiMessage` and call `sendMidiMessage`.)
- MIDI send observer: `setOutboundMidiObserver(cb)` / `clearOutboundMidiObserver()`
  — see "Outbound MIDI observer" below.
- Audio input: open/start/stop a capture stream, register a float-sample
  callback.
- File playback: `playSound` / `playMusic` / `playSoundAt`, `stopSound`,
  `setSoundVolume`, `fadeInSound` / `fadeOutSound`, `setBusVolume`,
  `setMasterVolume`, `setListenerPosition`. The Lua mirror is the `IRAudio`
  table (`engine/script/include/irreden/script/lua_audio_bindings.hpp`,
  bound by `bindLuaDrivenEcs()`).

## AudioManager owns

- **`MidiIn`** — one `RtMidiIn` per simultaneously-open input port, each
  with its own callback queue. `tick()` drains every port's queue into a
  `MidiInputFrameBuffer` (cleared and refilled each frame) that keeps both a
  merged all-ports per-channel view and a per-port view.
- **`MidiOut`** — one `RtMidiOut` per open output port; fire-and-forget send
  to the default (first-opened) port, or to a specific port by index.
- **`Audio`** — `RtAudio` wrapper for microphone/line-in. Implements
  `IAudioCaptureSource`. Used by `VideoManager` for recording soundtracks.
- **`AudioPlayback`** — miniaudio file playback (see below). `getAudioPlayback()`.

## File playback model (`AudioPlayback`)

`engine/audio/include/irreden/audio/audio_playback.hpp` — a pImpl wrapper
over miniaudio's **high-level engine** (`ma_engine` / `ma_sound` /
`ma_sound_group`). miniaudio is a private implementation detail: only
`src/audio_playback.cpp` defines `MINIAUDIO_IMPLEMENTATION`, and the
`ma_*` types never appear in any public header.

- **Library decision — miniaudio, high-level `ma_engine` API.** Single-
  header, public-domain, cross-platform (CoreAudio / WASAPI / ALSA) with
  built-in decoding, mixing, **sound groups (= our buses)**, a **listener +
  3D spatialization (= the #207 seam)**, per-sound volume/loop, and fades —
  so the engine code is a thin wrapper, not a device/decoder build-out.
  Vendored via `FetchContent` pinned to a tag (matches the RtMidi/RtAudio
  pattern), compiled playback-only with `MA_NO_ENCODING`. macOS links the
  CoreAudio frameworks; Linux pulls `pthread m dl` (ALSA is dlopen'd at
  runtime, no `-lasound`); Windows needs nothing extra (WASAPI via system).
  See `CMakeLists.txt`.
- **Buses.** `AudioBus { CREATURE, ENVIRONMENT, ABILITY, UI, MUSIC, COUNT }`
  (`ir_audio_types.hpp`) — one `ma_sound_group` each, parented under the
  engine endpoint. The integer values double as the C++ group-array index
  and the `IRAudio.Bus` Lua table; keep them contiguous from 0 with `COUNT`
  last. `setBusVolume` scales a whole category; `setMasterVolume` scales the
  engine.
- **Handles + lifetime.** `playSound` (decode-into-memory one-shot) /
  `playMusic` (streamed, loops by default) / `playSoundAt` (spatialized)
  return a `SoundHandle` into a handle table of heap-owned `ma_sound`s;
  `kInvalidSoundHandle` (0) on failure. A **finished one-shot is reaped on
  the main thread** by `tickPlayback()` — wired into `World::input()` next
  to `MidiIn::tick()` — never from miniaudio's audio callback. The reap rule
  is "non-looping AND no longer playing", which also covers a faded-out
  sound (`fadeOutSound` fades then stops). Looping sounds live until an
  explicit `stopSound`.
- **No device = silent, never a crash.** If `ma_engine_init` fails (no
  playback device, e.g. a headless box) `AudioPlayback` stays uninitialised:
  every `play*` returns `kInvalidSoundHandle` and the setters no-op.
- **Forward seams (depth is #207/#208, not built here).** `playSoundAt` +
  `setListenerPosition` drive the one built-in `ma_engine` listener and a
  sound's world position — #207 layers occlusion / biome ambience on this
  existing positional source. A world-time scheduler / bus-gain automation
  keyed on `IRSim::tick()` / `IRSim::cycleFraction` is the #208 seam (not
  stubbed; build it there).

The `creations/demos/audio_playback/` demo drives the whole surface from
Lua (`scripts/audio_demo.lua`).

## MIDI model

- **`MidiChannel`** is the map key. Query `IRAudio::checkCCMessage(channel,
  cc)` / `getMidiNotesOnThisFrame(channel)` for the **merged** all-ports
  view, or the port-scoped `checkCCMessage(portIndex, channel, cc)` /
  `getMidiNotesOnThisFrame(portIndex, channel)` to disambiguate same-channel
  traffic across ports. `openPortMidiIn`/`openPortMidiOut` return the RtMidi
  port index — the stable handle used as the source-port id, the
  `sendMidiMessage(portIndex, …)` target, and the per-port query key.
  `midiInOpenPorts()` / `midiOutOpenPorts()` enumerate the open handles.
- Inbound message entities carry `C_MidiSourcePort{portIndex}`; the
  `InputMidiMessageIn` system reads it to route each message into both the
  merged and per-port views. **Merged CC collapses same-channel+cc traffic
  (last write wins)** — use the per-port query when two devices share a
  channel.
- `MidiIn::tick()` is called by the INPUT pipeline; it drains every open
  port's RtMidi callback queue into the per-frame buffer. **State is cleared
  every frame** — no history. Systems must read during their tick or they
  miss the event.
- Device names are substring-matched at `openPort()` time, with hardcoded
  fallback patterns for common devices (UMC1820, Focusrite, MPKmini2,
  OP-1). Edit `midi_in.cpp` / `midi_out.cpp` to add a new hardware match.
  Opening an already-open port is a no-op that returns the existing handle.

## Outbound MIDI observer (#1869)

`IRAudio::sendMidiMessage` is the **sole outbound choke point** — every
prefab path (`CONTACT_MIDI_TRIGGER`, `MIDI_SEQUENCE_OUT`,
`PERIODIC_IDLE_MIDI_TRIGGER`, the `C_MidiNote::onDestroy` NOTE_OFF) routes
through it; nothing calls `getMidiOut().sendMessage()` directly. So a single
observer registered there sees **all** outbound traffic, including C++-emitted
messages a Lua-only monitor would otherwise miss.

```cpp
IRAudio::setOutboundMidiObserver(
    [](const IRComponents::C_MidiMessage &message, int portIndex) { /* ... */ }
);
IRAudio::clearOutboundMidiObserver();
```

- **Single observer, last-registration-wins** — matches the inbound
  `AudioInputCallback` precedent; multiplex in the handler if you need fan-out.
- **Fires unconditionally of an open port.** The observer runs even when no
  hardware output port is open (headless monitor); the actual hardware send
  no-ops below it. It fires *before* the hardware send.
- **Main thread, synchronous.** `sendMidiMessage` runs on the UPDATE pipeline
  (main thread), unlike the driver-thread inbound `MidiIn` callback. Don't move
  the send to a worker thread.
- **Storage + lifetime.** The callback is stored on `AudioManager`
  (`m_outboundMidiObserver`), not a TU-local static. A captured `sol::function`
  must outlive every send: `World` declares `m_audioManager` after `m_lua` so
  it destructs first, dropping the function while the `sol::state` is still
  alive. `clearOutboundMidiObserver()` is the explicit escape hatch.
- **Lua surface.** `IRAudio.onMidiSent(fn)` registers `fn(status, channel,
  data1, data2, portIndex)` (integers; `status` matches `IRAudio.MidiStatus.*`);
  `IRAudio.clearMidiObserver()` detaches. A Lua handler error is logged and
  swallowed so it can't abort the C++ send loop (bound by `bindLuaDrivenEcs()`
  in `lua_audio_bindings.hpp`).

## Audio capture model

- `Audio::openStreamIn(sampleRate, channels, framesPerBuffer)` →
  `startStreamIn(callback)`.
- Callback signature:
  `void(const float* samples, int frameCount, double streamTime, bool overflow)`.
- Default buffer is 1024 frames.
- The callback is invoked on RtAudio's audio thread — **do not touch ECS
  or Lua state from inside it**. Copy samples into a lock-free buffer and
  consume on the main thread.

## Gotchas

- **No hot-swap.** If a MIDI device is unplugged mid-run, the `RtMidiIn`
  callback stops firing silently. There is no reconnection logic.
- **Per-frame queue wipe.** Query MIDI state only in systems that run
  after `MidiIn::tick()` and before the next one. Holding a reference
  across frames is UB.
- **Callback lifetime.** The input callback is a `std::function`.
  Destroying `Audio` while a stream is running can crash; always
  `stopStreamIn()` before teardown.
- **Custom RtMidi/RtAudio patches.** Don't assume stock upstream behavior
  — check `patches/` before debugging driver-level issues.
- **Single-thread `tick()` assumption.** `MidiIn::tick()` has no mutex.
  Call it only from the main loop.
- **Callback log level.** Use `IRE_LOG_DEBUG`, never `IRE_LOG_INFO`, for
  per-message / per-event logging inside the RtMidi/RtAudio callbacks. They
  fire on the driver thread hundreds of times per second under a real-time
  clock (24 pps) or dense CC sweeps — `IRE_LOG_INFO` per message floods the
  log (and costs frame time) while staying invisible in sparse-traffic dev.
